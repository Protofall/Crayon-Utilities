# Crayon Utilities

This repository contains a few programs I have worked on to aid in Dreamcast homebrew and to use Dreamcast specific formats (Like DTEX files) on modern systems and taking modern image types and converting them into specific binaries for use on the Dreamcast.

The "Crayon" part of the name refers to my WIP 2D game frame-work I'm working on for the Sega Dreamcast and later PC OpenGL. Its very early on in development so I'm keeping it private for now. The programs here will be used as a part of Crayon, but aren't dependent on it so I figured I'd split the utilities off as their own project.

If you want to make homebrew for the Dreamcast, but don't want to write your own frame-work/engine then I recommend "Simulant". Its a game-engine for the Dreamcast, Windows, Linux, Mac and later Android, iOS and PSP (Maybe). Its still a WIP, but its publicly available and there's a community of people that can help you get started.
