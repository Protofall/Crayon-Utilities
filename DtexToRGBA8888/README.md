# Protofall's DTEX to RGBA8888 and PNG Converter

This program will take dtex files, generated by texconv https://github.com/tvspelsfreak/texconv, and turns them into RGBA8888 binaries as an easy format to load into modern graphics applications such as OpenGL. There is also a preview option that will use libpng to make a PNG output of your dtex file.

It doesn't support everything a dtex file can be. This is all it supports as of now:

+ ARGB1555, RGB565, ARGB4444, PAL4BPP, PAL8BPP texture formats
+ Twiddled and non-twiddled textures

Dependencies:

+ texconv (Only for generating example dtex files)
+ libpng (Only for PNG preview option)

Run `make` to compile a bunch of dtex files and the program itself.
Run `./DtexToRGBA8888 [dtex_filename] [rgba8888_binary_filename] *[--preview]` to convert a file.

### Credits

Jamo made the `get_twiddled_index()` funtion. Trying to figure out how to reverse the "Backwards-N" twiddle layout was boggling my mind so I'm very thankful for his help.

Airofoil made the `drawfy.png` sprite
