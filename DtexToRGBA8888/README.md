# Protofall's DTEX to RGBA8888 and PNG Converter

This program will take DTEX files, generated by texconv https://github.com/tvspelsfreak/texconv, and turns them into RGBA8888 binaries as an easy format to load into modern graphics applications such as OpenGL or as a PNG using libpng to easily view DTEX files on your computer.

It supports everthing except for mipmaps and BUMPMAP texture formats although adding support for those formats should be relatively easy

Dependencies:

+ texconv (Only for generating example DTEX files)
+ libpng (Only for PNG output option)
+ scons (Build language, use pip3)

Run `scons` to compile a bunch of dtex files and the program itself.
Run `./DtexToRGBA8888 [dtex_filename] *[--binary] [rgba8888_binary_filename] *[--png] [png_filename]` to convert a file. You must provide either a binary or a png path

### Credits

JamoHTP made the `get_twiddled_index()` funtion. Trying to figure out how to reverse the "Backwards-N" twiddle layout was boggling my mind so I'm very thankful for his help.

Airofoil made the `drawfy.png` sprite

People in the Dreamcast scene especially MrNeo240 for explaining some complex concepts and pointing me in the right direction
