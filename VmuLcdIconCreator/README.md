# Protofall's VMU LCD Bitmap Creator

This program will take a 48 wide by 32 high input image and create a 1bpp binary that can easily be displayed on a VMU screen. The input image must be a PNG now since I changed over to using libPNG for image reading (And writing)

Dependencies:

+ libPNG

Usage:
`./VmuLcdBitmapTool -i [png_filename] -o [filename] *--inv *-p [filename] *-s [scale factor]  *-f [frame count]`

The `--invert`/`--inv` parameter is optional, this will flip the vertical axis of the image. If writting a DC program that renders to the VMU then you'll want to set this flag (Since the VMU is upside down in the controller), but if you wanted to use this for a VMU in hand-held mode then you omit this flag.

`--scale`/`-s` will affect the output png image size, by default it is 1

`--frames`/`-f` is the number of LCD icon frames the binary will contain. By default its 1 and it can go up to 255.
